## WHAT YOU HAVE (THE FORMAL GUARANTEE)

### Theorem 4.1: PAC-Style Coverage Guarantee (N/U Algebra)

**Statement:**

Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be random variables with bounded support. Suppose each input satisfies:

$$\mathbb{P}\{X_i \in [n_i - u_i, n_i + u_i]\} \geq 1 - \frac{\alpha}{n}$$

Let $Y = f(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ for continuous function $f$. Propagate through N/U operations to get result $(n_f, u_f)$.

**Then:**

$$\mathbb{P}\{Y \in [n_f - u_f, n_f + u_f]\} \geq 1 - \alpha$$

**Proof Method:**
1. Union bound over n input failures
2. Enclosure-preserving multiplication (Lemma 3.3 with λ=1)
3. Continuity ensures no "gaps"

### Extension to U/N Algebra

The nested structure of U/N (two N/U pairs) means:

**Theorem 4.2: Inherited PAC Coverage for U/N**

The projected N/U of a U/N computation maintains PAC coverage:

$$\mathbb{P}\{Y \in [n_f - u_f, n_f + u_f]\} \geq 1 - \alpha$$

where $(n_f, u_f) = \pi(\text{UN}_{\text{result}})$

**Why this works:** U/N operations reduce to N/U operations on each nested tier → coverage inherits directly.

## WHAT THIS MEANS IN PRACTICE

### Example 1: Hubble Constant Measurement

**Scenario:** Merge early-universe (Planck) and late-universe (SH0ES) H₀ measurements

**Input Coverage (each):**
- Planck: H₀ = (67.4 ± 0.5) with P(true H₀ in interval) ≥ 0.99
- SH0ES: H₀ = (73.0 ± 1.0) with P(true H₀ in interval) ≥ 0.99

**Set α = 0.02 (95% total confidence):**
- Each input gets: 1 - α/2 = 0.99 ✓ (matches)

**Apply U/N Merge:**
```
un_early = UN(n_a=67.4, u_t=0.3, n_m=67.4, u_m=0.5)
un_late = UN(n_a=73.0, u_t=0.4, n_m=73.0, u_m=1.0)
result = hubble_UN_merge(un_early, un_late, Δ_T=1.3)
```

**Guarantee:** P(merged interval contains true H₀) ≥ 0.95 (without any distributional assumption)

### Example 2: AI Confidence Calibration

**Scenario:** Classify image; want provable confidence bounds

**Input:**
- Neural network returns class probability 0.87
- Calibration uncertainty: ±0.08
- Coverage interval: [0.79, 0.95]
- Confidence: P(true accuracy in interval) ≥ 0.98

**Output Guarantee:**
After any subsequent computation (combining with other models, post-processing), PAC guarantee carries forward → P(final interval contains true metric) ≥ 0.98

## CRITICAL QUALIFICATIONS

### 1. "Bounded Support" Assumption

**What it means:**
$$\mathbb{P}\{|X_i| \leq C_i\} = 1$$

**When this holds:**
- ✅ Measurement instruments (finite precision)
- ✅ Physical systems (finite energy/bounds)
- ✅ Engineering contexts (design specifications)
- ✅ Neural networks (bounded output: probability ∈ [0,1])

**When this fails:**
- ❌ Gaussian distributions (technically unbounded, but...)
- ❌ Heavy-tailed distributions (Cauchy, Pareto)
- ❌ Datasets with infinite variance

**Practical workaround for Gaussians:**
```
Gaussian X ~ N(μ, σ²)
Use C = μ + 3σ  (covers 99.7% of mass)
Then ℙ{|X| ≤ C} ≈ 0.997 (can set to 1 for practical purposes)

This is standard in GUM (Guide to Uncertainty in Measurement)
```

### 2. Union Bound is Conservative

**Reality:** Union bound allocation may be overly cautious

**Example:** With n=2 inputs
- Union bound requires: each gets α/2 failure budget
- Actual optimum might: split α/2 and α/3 (for correlated failures)

**Impact:** Your intervals are guaranteed conservative (never too narrow), but potentially wider than necessary

**Acceptable because:**
- Safety-critical systems want conservative bounds
- Regulatory compliance values provability over tightness

### 3. Independence Assumption

**Current guarantee assumes:** Either inputs are independent OR you're accounting for worst-case correlation

**Not addressed:**
- Partial correlations
- Time-series correlations
- Multivariate covariance structures

**Status in roadmap:** Deferred to Phase 4 (Correlation Extension)

### 4. "Enclosure-Preserving" is Key

**Why multiplication matters:**

The λ parameter in N/U multiplication:
$$u_{\text{result}} = |n_1|u_2 + |n_2|u_1 + \lambda u_1 u_2$$

**When λ = 1:** Exact match to interval arithmetic (Corollary 4.1 in your work)

**When λ > 1:** Conservative safety margin

**Impact:** 
- λ=1 is tightest possible without distributional assumptions
- λ > 1 adds margin for model uncertainty or regulatory requirements

## VALIDATION STATUS

### 70,000+ Test Cases (N/U Algebra)

**What was tested:**
- Closure (all operations produce valid pairs)
- Commutativity (⊕, ⊗ operators)
- Associativity (composition chains)
- Triangle inequality preservation
- Invariant M conservation
- Interval consistency with exact arithmetic
- Monte Carlo comparison (empirical verification)

**Results:** ✅ ZERO FAILURES across all 70,000+ cases

**Interpretation:** 
- If true failure rate ε exists, then P(ε > 0.01) < 10^(-33) by Chernoff bounds
- This is near-certain correctness (not just statistical confidence)

### Phase 3 Plan: 102,000+ Cases (U/N Algebra)

**Planned for Phase 3 execution:**
- 5k unit tests (properties)
- 50k fuzz tests (random sequences)
- 20k projection tests (N/U compatibility)
- 15k interval tests (bounds)
- 10k scenario tests (real applications)
- 2k operator tests (Catch, Flip)

**Expected outcome:** Zero failures → PAC confidence < 10^(-33)

## HOW TO STATE THIS FORMALLY

### For Academic Papers

> "We prove a PAC-style coverage guarantee: if each input random variable $X_i$ satisfies $\mathbb{P}\{X_i \in [n_i - u_i, n_i + u_i]\} \geq 1 - α/n$, then the propagated result $(n_f, u_f)$ satisfies $\mathbb{P}\{Y \in [n_f - u_f, n_f + u_f]\} \geq 1 - α$ via union bound allocation and enclosure-preserving operations. This guarantee requires no distributional assumptions beyond bounded support, suitable for regulatory and safety-critical contexts."

### For Regulatory/FDA Context

> "The N/U Algebra framework provides deterministic, non-probabilistic bounds on system outputs that guarantee coverage: given uncertainty intervals for each input, all possible outputs lie within the computed output interval with probability ≥ (1-α). This is formally proven and validated on 70,000+ test cases."

### For Lay Audience

> "When you use N/U Algebra to combine measurements with error bars, you get a guarantee: the true answer lies in your computed interval at least (1-α) of the time, no matter what the underlying data distribution looks like."
