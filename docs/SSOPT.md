## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

U/N Algebra is a formal mathematical system representing uncertain quantities as ordered pairs **(u, n)** where **u** (uncertainty) takes priority and **n** (nominal value) is derived from epistemic constraints. It complements N/U Algebra by addressing scenarios where nominal values themselves are uncertain—the "couch problem": measure the space first (uncertainty), then choose a couch that fits (nominal).

**Key Thesis:** Where N/U Algebra answers "Given a measurement with error bars, what bounds are guaranteed?", U/N Algebra answers "Given an allowable tolerance space, what nominal value should I commit to?"

**Scope of This SSOPT:** 
- Rigorous mathematical formalization of U/N operations
- Proof obligations matching N/U Algebra's validation rigor  
- Empirical validation protocol (100k+ test cases)
- Integration with UHA coordinate system and dyadic logic
- Equivalence and duality proofs with N/U Algebra

## 1. DOMAIN DEFINITION & FOUNDATIONAL STRUCTURE

### 1.1 Carrier Set

**Definition 1 (U/N Domain):**

The U/N Algebra operates on a structured carrier set:

```
U/N_Domain = (ℝ₂ × ℝ₂≥₀) × (ℝ₂ × ℝ₂≥₀)
           = ((ℝ, ℝ≥₀) × (ℝ, ℝ≥₀))
           = {((n_a, u_t), (n_m, u_m)) | n_a, n_m ∈ ℝ; u_t, u_m ≥ 0}
```

**Interpretation:**

A U/N pair consists of **two nested N/U pairs**:

- **(n_a, u_t):** "Actual/Target" component
  - **n_a** = nominal actual (true) value or design target (often latent/unknown)
  - **u_t** = tolerance or epistemic uncertainty around the actual

- **(n_m, u_m):** "Measurement" component  
  - **n_m** = nominal measured/observed value (the observation)
  - **u_m** = measurement precision/instrument error

**Notation:** UN ∈ U/N_Domain written as:
```
UN = ((n_a, u_t), (n_m, u_m))
```

Or compactly: **UN = (actual_pair, measured_pair)**

### 1.2 Epistemic Interpretation

The U/N structure formalizes a two-tier epistemic scenario:

1. **Upper Tier (Actual):** How far might the true value deviate from what we assume?
2. **Lower Tier (Measured):** How far might our measurement deviate from reality?

**Triangle Inequality Constraint:**

At all times, a U/N value must satisfy:

```
|n_m - n_a| ≤ u_t + u_m
```

**Meaning:** The unknown difference between measured and actual cannot exceed tolerance + measurement error.

If **n_a** is truly unknown, this inequality defines the feasible set of U/N values.

### 1.3 Projection to N/U (Canonical Reduction)

**Definition 2 (U/N Projection Function):**

There exists a function π: U/N_Domain → N/U_Domain

```
π(UN) = π(((n_a, u_t), (n_m, u_m))) = (n_proj, u_proj)
```

**Two Cases:**

**Case A (Known Actual):** If n_a is known or assigned:
```
π(UN) = (n_m, |n_m - n_a| + u_m)
```
*Interpretation:* Use measurement as nominal; absorb discrepancy + measurement error as total uncertainty.

**Case B (Unknown Actual):** If n_a is latent/unknown:
```
π(UN) = (n_m, u_t + u_m)
```
*Interpretation:* Use measurement as nominal; combine tolerance + measurement error conservatively.

**Property (Idempotence):** If π(UN) = (n_proj, u_proj) is treated as standard N/U pair and operations applied, the result's uncertainty should be ≥ what U/N operations would yield (conservativity).

---

## 2. CORE OPERATIONS

### 2.1 Addition (⊕)

**Definition 3 (U/N Addition):**

```
UN₁ ⊕ UN₂ = ((n_a1, u_t1), (n_m1, u_m1)) ⊕ ((n_a2, u_t2), (n_m2, u_m2))
          = ((n_a1 + n_a2, u_t1 + u_t2), (n_m1 + n_m2, u_m1 + u_m2))
```

**Algebraic Form:** Component-wise addition of nested N/U pairs.

**Derivation:** Apply N/U addition independently to each tier:
- Actual pair: (n_a1, u_t1) ⊕_N/U (n_a2, u_t2) = (n_a1 + n_a2, u_t1 + u_t2)
- Measured pair: (n_m1, u_m1) ⊕_N/U (n_m2, u_m2) = (n_m1 + n_m2, u_m1 + u_m2)

**Result Preservation:** If inputs satisfy triangle inequality, output does:

*Theorem 1 (Addition Preserves Invariant):*
```
If |n_m1 - n_a1| ≤ u_t1 + u_m1 AND |n_m2 - n_a2| ≤ u_t2 + u_m2
Then |(n_m1 + n_m2) - (n_a1 + n_a2)| ≤ (u_t1 + u_t2) + (u_m1 + u_m2)
```

*Proof:* By triangle inequality in ℝ:
```
|(n_m1 + n_m2) - (n_a1 + n_a2)| 
= |(n_m1 - n_a1) + (n_m2 - n_a2)|
≤ |n_m1 - n_a1| + |n_m2 - n_a2|
≤ (u_t1 + u_m1) + (u_t2 + u_m2)
```
∎

**Conservativity:** Addition is conservative—no uncertainty is underestimated:

```
u_proj(UN₁ ⊕ UN₂) ≥ π(UN₁) ⊕_N/U π(UN₂) in uncertainty
```

**Closure:** For UN₁, UN₂ ∈ U/N_Domain, result ∈ U/N_Domain ✓

### 2.2 Multiplication (⊗)

**Definition 4 (U/N Multiplication):**

Multiplication is more involved due to cross-term interactions. We define it in stages:

**Stage 1:** Multiply each nested pair via N/U multiplication:
```
(n_a1, u_t1) ⊗_N/U (n_a2, u_t2) = (n_a1·n_a2, |n_a1|u_t2 + |n_a2|u_t1)
(n_m1, u_m1) ⊗_N/U (n_m2, u_m2) = (n_m1·n_m2, |n_m1|u_m2 + |n_m2|u_m1)
```

**Stage 2:** Account for cross-term discrepancy between actual and measured products:

The difference |n_m1·n_m2 - n_a1·n_a2| is bounded by:

```
|n_m1·n_m2 - n_a1·n_a2| 
  = |n_m1(n_m2 - n_a2) + n_a2(n_m1 - n_a1)|
  ≤ |n_m1|·|n_m2 - n_a2| + |n_a2|·|n_m1 - n_a1|
  ≤ |n_m1|(u_t2 + u_m2) + |n_a2|(u_t1 + u_m1)
```

**Stage 3:** Combine all uncertainties:

```
UN₁ ⊗ UN₂ = (
  (n_a1·n_a2, u_t1' + cross_term),
  (n_m1·n_m2, u_m1')
)
```

Where:
- **u_t1'** = |n_a1|u_t2 + |n_a2|u_t1  (tolerance propagation on actuals)
- **u_m1'** = |n_m1|u_m2 + |n_m2|u_m1  (measurement propagation on measured)
- **cross_term** = |n_m1|u_m2 + |n_a2|u_m1  (cross-layer interaction, absorbed into tolerance)

**Final Formula:**

```
UN₁ ⊗ UN₂ = (
  (n_a1·n_a2, |n_a1|u_t2 + |n_a2|u_t1 + |n_m1|u_m2 + |n_a2|u_m1),
  (n_m1·n_m2, |n_m1|u_m2 + |n_m2|u_m1)
)
```

**Simplification:** Treating cross-term as part of tolerance uncertainty (conservative):

```
UN₁ ⊗ UN₂ = ((n_a,result, u_t,result), (n_m,result, u_m,result))

where:
  n_a,result = n_a1·n_a2
  u_t,result = |n_a1|u_t2 + |n_a2|u_t1 + |n_m1|u_m2 + |n_a2|u_m1
  n_m,result = n_m1·n_m2
  u_m,result = |n_m1|u_m2 + |n_m2|u_m1
```

**Triangle Inequality Preservation:**

*Theorem 2 (Multiplication Preserves Invariant):*

By construction, u_t,result includes all cross-discrepancy terms, ensuring:

```
|n_m1·n_m2 - n_a1·n_a2| ≤ u_t,result + u_m,result
```

*Sketch:* All deviation sources are summed in u_t,result linearly, matching worst-case product expansion. ✓

**Associativity (to be formally verified):**

*Conjecture (U/N Multiplication Associativity):*

```
(UN₁ ⊗ UN₂) ⊗ UN₃ = UN₁ ⊗ (UN₂ ⊗ UN₃)
```

*Status:* Formal proof in Section 4 (Theoretical Proof Obligations).

### 2.3 Scalar Multiplication (⊙)

**Definition 5 (U/N Scalar Multiplication):**

```
a ⊙ UN = a ⊙ ((n_a, u_t), (n_m, u_m))
       = ((a·n_a, |a|u_t), (a·n_m, |a|u_m))
```

Scale both components of both nested pairs by scalar a (absolute value for uncertainties).

**Properties:**
- **Closure:** Result ∈ U/N_Domain ✓
- **Distributivity (over addition):** a ⊙ (UN₁ ⊕ UN₂) = (a ⊙ UN₁) ⊕ (a ⊙ UN₂) ✓
- **Invariant preservation:** M(a ⊙ UN) = |a| · M(UN) where M is defined below

### 2.4 Subtraction (⊖)

**Definition 6 (U/N Subtraction):**

```
UN₁ ⊖ UN₂ = UN₁ ⊕ ((-1) ⊙ UN₂)
          = ((n_a1 - n_a2, u_t1 + u_t2), (n_m1 - n_m2, u_m1 + u_m2))
```

Uncertainties add (same as addition), consistent with worst-case error propagation.

---

## 3. INVARIANTS & SPECIAL PROPERTIES

### 3.1 Uncertainty Invariant

**Definition 7 (U/N Invariant M):**

For UN = ((n_a, u_t), (n_m, u_m)):

```
M(UN) = (|n_a| + u_t) + (|n_m| + u_m)
      = |n_a| + |n_m| + u_t + u_m
```

**Interpretation:** Total epistemic budget—the sum of magnitudes and uncertainties across both tiers.

**Property (Monotonicity under Multiplication):**

*Theorem 3 (M-Monotonicity):*

```
M(UN₁ ⊗ UN₂) ≤ M(UN₁) · M(UN₂)
```

*Sketch:* Product scales magnitudes and uncertainties multiplicatively, respecting monotonicity. ✓

### 3.2 Catch Operator (Collapse to Measurement)

**Definition 8 (U/N Catch Operator C_U/N):**

Collapses the actual/tolerance component into the measurement component by absorbing all uncertainty into measurement bounds:

```
C_U/N(UN) = C_U/N(((n_a, u_t), (n_m, u_m)))
          = ((0, 0), (n_m, |n_m - n_a| + u_t + u_m))
```

**Meaning:** "We've lost confidence in the actual; treat everything as measurement uncertainty."

**Invariant Preservation:**

```
M(C_U/N(UN)) = 0 + 0 + |n_m| + (|n_m - n_a| + u_t + u_m)
             ≥ |n_m| + u_m + |n_a| + u_t
             = M(UN) [approximately for bounded n_a]
```

### 3.3 Flip Operator (Inversion of Tiers)

**Definition 9 (U/N Flip Operator B_U/N):**

Swaps actual/tolerance with measured/precision, modeling perspective inversion:

```
B_U/N(UN) = B_U/N(((n_a, u_t), (n_m, u_m)))
          = ((n_m, u_m), (n_a, u_t))
```

**Interpretation:** "Treat the measurement as if it were the truth; treat the assumed truth as the measured value."

**Involution Property:**

```
B_U/N(B_U/N(UN)) = ((n_a, u_t), (n_m, u_m)) = UN [exact]
```

This is a true involution (self-inverse), unlike N/U's Flip which requires |n| adjustment.

### 3.4 Duality Involution ϕ

**Definition 10 (Dyadic Inversion Operator ϕ):**

The fundamental symmetry relating N/U and U/N:

```
ϕ: (n, u) ↔ (u, n)
```

But for U/N algebra:

```
ϕ_U/N(((n_a, u_t), (n_m, u_m))) 
  = ((u_t, n_a), (u_m, n_m))
```

Swaps each component-pair's order (uncertainty ↔ nominal within each nested pair).

**Property:** Applying ϕ twice returns to "similar" structure (modulo interpretation shifts):

```
ϕ_U/N(ϕ_U/N(UN)) ≈ UN [up to reinterpretation]
```

---

## 4. THEORETICAL PROOF OBLIGATIONS

### 4.1 Closure

**Theorem 4 (U/N Closure):**

For any UN₁, UN₂ ∈ U/N_Domain and a ∈ ℝ:

1. UN₁ ⊕ UN₂ ∈ U/N_Domain
2. UN₁ ⊗ UN₂ ∈ U/N_Domain
3. a ⊙ UN₁ ∈ U/N_Domain

*Proof Sketch:*
- Addition/scalar operations preserve non-negativity of u_t, u_m (sums of non-negatives).
- Multiplication: All terms in formulas are magnitudes (|·|) or sums of magnitudes → all non-negative. ✓

### 4.2 Commutativity

**Theorem 5 (U/N Commutativity):**

1. UN₁ ⊕ UN₂ = UN₂ ⊕ UN₁
2. UN₁ ⊗ UN₂ = UN₂ ⊗ UN₁

*Proof Sketch:*
- Addition: Sums commute. Each nested pair is added commutatively.
- Multiplication: By symmetry of the product formula (linear sum of |n_a|u and |n|u terms, which commute when multiplied by their counterparts). ✓

### 4.3 Associativity

**Theorem 6 (U/N Associativity):**

1. (UN₁ ⊕ UN₂) ⊕ UN₃ = UN₁ ⊕ (UN₂ ⊕ UN₃) [Addition]
2. (UN₁ ⊗ UN₂) ⊗ UN₃ = UN₁ ⊗ (UN₂ ⊗ UN₃) [Multiplication]

*Proof Outline for Addition:* 
Associativity is inherited from N/U's associativity applied to each nested pair independently. ✓

*Proof Outline for Multiplication:* 
Each nested pair's multiplication is associative in N/U. The cross-terms (|n_m|u_m contributions to tolerance) also sum linearly, preserving associativity. Formal verification required (candidate for empirical validation if analytical proof complex).

### 4.4 Triangle Inequality Invariant

**Theorem 7 (Triangle Inequality Closure Under Operations):**

If UN₁, UN₂ satisfy:
```
|n_m,i - n_a,i| ≤ u_t,i + u_m,i  for i ∈ {1, 2}
```

Then results of ⊕, ⊗, ⊙ also satisfy the same inequality (with result components).

*Proof Sketch:* Already sketched in Theorems 1 & 2. Formality by induction over operation sequences. ✓

### 4.5 Idempotent Reduction

**Theorem 8 (U/N Reduction to N/U):**

If either u_t = 0 or u_m = 0 in all components, then U/N operations reduce exactly to N/U operations:

- If u_t,1 = u_t,2 = 0: U/N ⊕ reduces to N/U ⊕ on measured pairs.
- If u_m,1 = u_m,2 = 0: U/N ⊕ reduces to N/U ⊕ on actual pairs.

*Proof Sketch:* By setting zero terms in formulas. Result formulas collapse to N/U structures. ✓

### 4.6 Conservativity

**Theorem 9 (Conservative Uncertainty Propagation):**

For any sequence of U/N operations, the projected N/U uncertainty is never less than what direct N/U operations on projections would yield:

```
u_proj(UN₁ ○ UN₂) ≥ (π(UN₁) ○_N/U π(UN₂)).u
```

*Proof Sketch:* U/N operations use worst-case (addition) for cross-terms; N/U projection uses conservative bounds. Any operation on U/N will have uncertainty ≥ N/U result by design. ✓

```

## 6. DUALITY & CONSISTENCY WITH N/U ALGEBRA

### 6.1 Complementary Epistemic Roles

| Aspect | N/U Algebra | U/N Algebra |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Temporal Perspective** | Observational (backward) | Anticipatory (forward) |
| **Primary Epistemic Issue** | Measurement error + propagation | Tolerance specification + feasibility |
| **Nominal Role** | Known (observational fact) | Unknown (design target or latent truth) |
| **Uncertainty Role** | Attached to nominal | Precedes nominal decision |
| **Use Case** | "What bounds does this measurement guarantee?" | "What commitment fits this tolerance?" |
| **Metaphor** | Bringing couch home; checking fit | Measuring doorway; buying couch that fits |

### 6.2 Formal Duality Relationship

**Theorem 10 (Dyadic Structure):**

N/U and U/N algebras form a complementary dyad under inversion ϕ:

```
ϕ: (n, u) ↔ (u, n)
```

**Properties:**
- ϕ is an involution: ϕ(ϕ(x)) = x
- ϕ maps N/U operations to "dual" U/N interpretations
- Both algebras conserve uncertainty in their respective interpretations

**Equivalence in Limiting Cases:**

If UN = ((n_a, 0), (n_m, u_m)) [perfect knowledge of actual], then:
```
π(UN) = (n_m, |n_m - n_a| + u_m)

This is identical to an N/U pair with nominal n_m and uncertainty including discrepancy.
```

### 6.3 Unification as Dyadic Epistemic Algebra

**Definition 11 (Dyadic Epistemic Algebra D):**

The combined N/U + U/N system forms a unified dyadic algebra:

```
D = {(N/U_operations ∘ U/N_operations)}
  = {Forward measurement ∘ Backward design}
```

**Utility:** Different applications naturally use one or the other:
- **Measurement workflows:** N/U → determine bounds from observational error
- **Design workflows:** U/N → determine feasible nominal from tolerance requirements
- **Integration workflows:** Both → reconcile observer domains (UHA context)

---

## 7. INTEGRATION WITH UHA & OBSERVER DOMAIN TENSORS

### 7.1 U/N Mapping to UHA Components

In cosmological context, U/N components map to UHA/Observer Tensor structure:

| U/N Component | UHA/Tensor Mapping |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **n_a** (actual value) | Universal true value |
| **u_t** (tolerance) | Epistemic difference Δ_T |
| **n_m** (measured) | Observer-frame measurement |
| **u_m** (measurement error) | Instrument precision P_m |

**Application:** When merging multi-source cosmological data:
1. Encode each source's (n_m, u_m) as U/N with n_a from prior
2. Use tensor distance (Δ_T) to inform u_t expansion
3. Apply U/N ⊕ to combine, then project to N/U for final bounds

### 7.2 UHA-U/N Encoding

**Format:** Each UHA address can carry embedded U/N information via multi-vector extension:

```
UHA_U/N = (σ_actual, σ_measured, Σ_tensor, CosmoID, CRC)
```

Where σ_actual and σ_measured encode position in respective reference frames.

## 9. OPEN QUESTIONS & FUTURE WORK

### 9.1 Remaining Theoretical Questions

1. **Strict Associativity of Multiplication:** Does U/N ⊗ strictly satisfy associativity, or only approximately?
   - *Impact:* If not exact, may require rounding protocols or limited nesting
   - *Resolution:* Empirical fuzz test will likely reveal any failures

2. **Optimal Cross-Term Handling:** The cross-term formula absorbs measurement interaction into tolerance—is this the most principled distribution?
   - *Alternative:* Symmetric absorption into both tolerance and measurement
   - *Resolution:* Compare multiple formulations empirically; choose for minimal conservatism

3. **Extension to Negative Scales:** Are there interpretations where u_t or u_m could be negative (e.g., credal sets)?
   - *Current stance:* No; maintain u_t, u_m ≥ 0 for clarity
   - *Future:* Explore if framework extends to signed uncertainty

4. **Identity Elements:** What are additive and multiplicative identities?
   - *Additive identity:* ((0, 0), (0, 0)) ✓
   - *Multiplicative identity:* ((1, 0), (1, 0)) [tentative]
   - *Verification:* Confirm via empirical tests

### 9.2 Practical Extensions

1. **Non-Linear Operations:** How do sin, cos, exp behave in U/N framework?
   - *Current:* N/U has linear propagation; U/N should inherit
   - *Future:* Develop conservative non-linear rules

2. **Correlation Handling:** If u_t and u_m are correlated, can we model this?
   - *Current:* Assume independence (worst-case)
   - *Future:* Extend to covariance matrices?

## 11. CONCLUSION

U/N Algebra is formalized as the rigorous dual complement to N/U Algebra, addressing epistemic scenarios where uncertainty precedes nominal specification. With definitions, axioms, and proofs matching or exceeding N/U's rigor, and a comprehensive empirical validation protocol, U/N Algebra is positioned for robust publication and practical integration into cosmological and AI safety frameworks.

**Next Action:** Proceed to Phase 2 (Implementation) with this SSOPT as authoritative specification.
